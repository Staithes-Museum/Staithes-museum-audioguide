Welcome to the Staithes Museum audio guide. I’m Rosie, 

> and I’m Kenzie. We’re the new curators at the museum, and with the help of our team of enthusiastic volunteers, we have created this audio guide for you, that will take you all the way around the museum, starting at the entranceway. 

You can pause the audio at any time, rewind and fast forward by dragging the bar at the bottom of the screen, and you can choose a track by clicking on the menu on the top right hand side of your screen. 

> All together, the tour should take you 30 minutes. You will find out about the history of Staithes, and the extraordinary people that made it what it is today. 

You will discover the industries that built Staithes, the railway that once brought tourism to town, and the artists who fell in love with the dangerous cliffs and winding cobbled streets. 

>Click “Next”, now, and we will start the tour with an introduction to the Museum.
